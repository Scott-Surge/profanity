# The Obscenity List
*by [Surge AI](https://www.surgehq.ai)*

Ever wish you had a ready-made list of profanity? Maybe you want to remove NSFW comments, filter offensive usernames, or build content moderation tools, and you can't dream up enough obscenities on your own.

We're creating the world's largest profanity dataset, in 20+ languages.

This repo contains 1600+ popular US English profanities and their variations. We'll be adding more languages and profanity annotations (e.g., augmenting each profanity with its severity level, type, and other variations) over time.

Need a larger set of expletives and slurs, or a list of swear words in other languages (Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, etc)? We love feedback. Post an issue or reach out to profanity@surgehq.ai!
